# A General Overview - The Essence of the Annual Report 

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948, establishes the right to access information as an integral part of freedom of expression, as outlined in Article 19. This right includes the freedom to seek, receive, and impart information, regardless of frontiers. This foundational principle underpins the global recognition of access to information as a fundamental human right.

In Ghana, the right of access to information is enshrined in Article 21(1)(f) of the 1992 Constitution and further operationalised through the Right to Information Act, 2019 (Act 989), which was passed by Parliament to promote transparency and accountability in public institutions. The Right to Information Commission (the Commission/RTIC) is established under Act 989 with the mandate to promote, monitor, protect, and enforce the right of access to information in accordance with the law. 

Prior to the passage of Act 989, many Ghanaians faced significant challenges in accessing public information, often encountering administrative obstructions and a lack of institutional responsiveness. The establishment of the Commission has, over the past four years, addressed these challenges and promoted a culture of openness in governance. The Commission has actively engaged in monitoring and compliance exercises, ensuring that public institutions adhere to the provisions of Act 989 by responding to information requests in a timely and transparent manner. 

The Annual Report usually provides a comprehensive account of the Commission's activities, achievements, and challenges for the reporting year. It details the operational initiatives undertaken, the strategies used to promote awareness and understanding of the RTI Act, and the Commission's commitment to strengthening institutional and stakeholder partnerships.

Furthermore, the report serves as a tool for accountability, enabling Parliament, development partners, and the public to evaluate the Commission's performance in fulfilling its statutory mandate.

In this file, I have shared some selected analysis run from Power Bi and the findings from data gathered for the 2024 annual report. It covers the applications received by various public institutions, the regional distribution of information requests, the mode of submission, compliance rate and a comparative analysis between the year 2023 and 2024. 


## A brief overview of the 2024 Annual Report of the Right to Information Commission
I have selected the 2024 report to display results from and describe what the document normally entails. There are about another 3 annual reports from the previous years. The 2025 report is still being compiled. The previous year's report is normally compiled in the preceding year as we go through a documented process with all information officers across all sixteen (16) regions.

## Applications and Requests Received by Public Institutions

![Applications and Requests Received](https://github.com/itmartey/Data-Science-Mastery/blob/main/IMAGES/Apps_Request_Received.jpg)

In 2024, public institutions received a total of seven hundred and twenty-five (725) applications, which generated two thousand five hundred and seventy-five (2,575) individual requests for information. This suggests that each application triggered, on average, more than three (3) requests, emphasising both the complexity of citizen inquiries and the scale of engagement with public institutions.


## Comparative Analysis of Request Received by Public Institutions - 2023 & 2024

![Comparative Analysis](https://github.com/itmartey/Data-Science-Mastery/blob/main/IMAGES/Comparative_2023_2024.png)

When compared to 2023, the data reveals notable growth across most metrics. The total number of requests increased by forty-seven percent (47.2%), increasing from one thousand, seven hundred and forty-nine (1749) to two thousand, five hundred and seventy-five (2,575), a clear indicator of rising public engagement or awareness of access to information rights. Correspondingly, approved requests also grew by forty-two percent (42.9%), from one thousand, two hundred and twenty-five (1,225) to one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-one (1,751), maintaining a relatively stable approval rate.

## Regional Distribution of Annual Reports Submitted by Public Institutions in the year 2024.

[Regional Distribution of Annual Reports](https://github.com/itmartey/Data-Science-Mastery/blob/main/IMAGES/Regional_distribution.png)

The submission of annual reports by public institutions in 2024 followed a skewed pattern. Of the total three hundred and forty-five (345) reports received, Greater Accra alone accounted for two hundred and two (202), which is approximately fifty-eight percent (58.55%) of the national total. This figure represents an institutional compliance rate that far exceeds any other region, reinforcing the region's administrative dominance.

The Ashanti Region, with thirty-nine (39) reports representing eleven percent (11.30%), and the Eastern Region, with thirty-one (31) reports representing over eight percent (8.99%), followed at a considerable distance. Other regions, including Central with four percent (4.06%), Bono with two percent (2.32%), and Volta with two percent (2.32%), contributed modestly. At the lowest end of the spectrum, North East submitted only one report, and Western North submitted none at all.

When compared with 2023, the overall number of reports grew modestly by 6.8%, but this increase was largely driven by incremental gains in high-performing regions. There was little to no change in activity reporting from the majority of low-submission regions, suggesting a structural or systemic limitation in those areas. The data therefore reflects not just a disparity in regional output but also a potential disconnect in institutional compliance and enforcement mechanisms.

The heavy concentration of report submissions in Greater Accra and a few select regions indicates a centralized pattern of administrative activity, potentially influenced by better resourcing, oversight, and proximity to national RTI authorities. In contrast, the consistent underperformance of other regions points to capacity gaps, possible lack of enforcement, or insufficient awareness among institutional heads about reporting obligations.

To promote a more balanced reporting ecosystem, there is a need to strengthen institutional accountability frameworks, offer region-specific capacity-building, and ensure routine follow- up on non-compliance. These efforts would not only improve the completeness of national RTI data but also enhance public trust and transparency across all levels of government.


## Mode of Submission 

![Mode of submission](https://github.com/itmartey/Data-Science-Mastery/blob/main/IMAGES/mode_of_submission.png)

In-person submissions accounted for sixty-eight percent (68.92%), indicating a continued reliance on physical presence, which could reflect either limited digital infrastructure, user preference for direct interaction, or institutional policies that favour face-to-face communication. Electronic submissions, at thirty-one percent (31.08%), represent a significant but secondary channel. This suggests a growing digital adoption trend, though barriers such as digital literacy, access, or trust in electronic systems may still need to be addressed to encourage broader use. 



## Compliance Rate / Compliance Check

![Compliance Check](https://github.com/itmartey/Data-Science-Mastery/blob/main/IMAGES/Compliance_rate.png)


Over the past three years, the Commission's monitoring efforts have expanded substantially, underscoring its dedication to promoting institutional accountability and transparency in accordance with Act 989. The total number of institutions monitored rose from one hundred and forty-nine (149) in 2022 to two hundred and fifty (250) in 2023, which shows an increase of approximately sixty-seven percent (67.1%). This upward trajectory continued in 2024, with the number reaching three hundred and twenty-nine (329), representing an additional increase of about thirty-two percent (31.6%). Overall, this marks a cumulative rise of roughly one hundred and twenty-one percent (120.8%) in institutional monitoring coverage across the three-year period. 

The trend in compliance has likewise been encouraging. As depicted by the teal line in the accompanying graph, the number of compliant institutions has consistently increased year on year. While the total number of both compliant and non-compliant institutions has grown in absolute terms, the average growth rate of compliant institutions of approximately fifty-three percent (52.5%) exceeds that of the non-compliant institutions of approximately forty-six percent (45.5%). This positive trend suggests that the Commission's sustained monitoring, capacity-building, and enforcement activities are fostering a steady improvement in institutional compliance. Nonetheless, the concurrent rise in non-compliant institutions underscores the persistent need for strategic interventions to close the compliance gap.
