# The Impact of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) on Easy Access to Information – How Information Technology (IT) Can Promote Easy Access to Information.

## The Executive Summary 

The "Right to Information" is being viewed primarily as a legal obligation. This research was aimed at shifting that perspective, arguing that Access to Information is fundamentally a data management challenge. During my time with the Commission, I analyzed how digital systems serve as the bridge between bureaucratic databases and the public. We mbvmbv't just moving from paper to screens. We are moving from "hidden data" to "actionable insights." If the IT infrastructure is weak, the legal right is effectively unenforceable.

## Objectives 

1. To investigate the importance of ICT tools in facilitating ease of requesting for, and the supply of information by duty bearers.

2. To identify technological tools adopted by public institutions to process and provide information to applicants.

3. To provide recommendations that can enhance/improve access to and providing information via technological platforms.
